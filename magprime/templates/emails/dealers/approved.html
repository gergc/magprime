<br/> <br/><strong>New Tax Information <span style="color:red">*Please Read*</span></strong>
<p>All sellers in the Marketplace are required to obtain a Seller's Permit from the State of Maryland. To ease the burden on the Comptroller's office 
    for issuing mass permits, we submit the names of our sellers in advance to ensure everyone has the right documentation; the Comptroller's office 
    then issues the seller's permits directly to you. We will be sending out an email at a future date with more directions on the tax info for the Comptroller.
    <strong>Finally, if you are multiple Artists or Vendors sharing the same table space through an approved table share or you applied and were accepted together: 
        then each individual seller *MUST* provide the Maryland Comptroller their information above and get their own exhibitor's affidavit.</strong></p>

<p>By paying for your table(s) and assigning your badge(s), you and anyone with badges associated with your table agree to abide by and follow these rules and guidelines.
