<br><br>
To help speed up check-in, please bring the 2D barcode below with you when you
pick up your badge. You can print it out or display it on your phone.
<br><br>
This code is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for
your photo ID. You must still present your government-issued photo ID when picking up your badge.
<br><br>
You are also required to provide <a href="{{ c.COVID_POLICIES_URL }}" target="_blank">proof of vaccination</a> 
before picking up your badge. In order to simplify this process you can verify your record ahead of time here:<br>
<a href="https://vax.magfest.org/?id={{ attendee.public_id }}">https://vax.magfest.org/?id={{ attendee.public_id }}</a>
<br><br>
You may not pick up badges on behalf of other attendees, even if you have a
copy of their barcode and ID. You must bring proof of vaccination regardless of whether you
pre-verified it as on-site staff have the final call in determining eligibility.
