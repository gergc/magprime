You are receiving this email because you ticked an interest in <i>PC Gaming</i> (LAN) while pre-registering for MAGFest. We highly recommend bringing your own computer to fully enjoy the MAGFest LAN experience. <b>Due to limited availability of our Public PCs, our LAN tournaments are reserved for BYOC "Bring Your Own Computer" participants only.</b>
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>REMINDERS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
Please pre-register your LAN items by <a href="https://forms.gle/DDyab9GA2oaU8opi6">filling out our online form</a> to zip through initial check-in.
<br/> <br/>
Bring an ethernet cable 20 feet long or longer. We offer 20ft network cables at $5 each while quantities last. If gaming on a laptop make sure it has a wired network port. USB network adapters are $15 each while quantities last.
<br/> <br/>
Don't forget your power strip. Bring headphones/mic/headset and leave your speakers at home.
<br/> <br/>
Please update your OS and games before coming to MAGFest LAN. We try our best to provide enough bandwidth for everyone&mdash;saving every little bit counts. We don't want anyone stuck waiting hours for updates while friends play!
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>NEWS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
Welcome back to MAGFest! This year LAN is trying something new! We are changing things up and looking for more party games and quick to pick up games to play over the weekend. We are also introducing blocks of time for genres of games. Be it something to play on the LAN Theater or a game we can all play together. Obviously as our capabilities are limited, this means that the overall number of discrete tournaments has reduced, with the goal of having higher quality events and a greater focus on community interaction.
<br/><br/>
We will be introducing four unique <b>LAN Villages</b> this year, consisting of areas for: FPS, Sims & Building, RTS & MOBA, and RPGs. This doesn't mean you can't play other games in those areas - it is just a way to help find players of similar interest. If you missed our previous announcement and want to know more about the Villages, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magfestlan/comments/zhed18/magfest_2023_lan_announcements_1_of_2/">check out the announcement here.</a>
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>PUBLIC COMPUTERS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
We are excited to continue our partnership with <a href="http://www.cukusa.com">Computer Upgrade King</a>, <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/">Corsair</a> and welcome our new partner <a href="https://us.aoc.com/en-US/gaming/agon">AGON by AOC</a>. They are providing 50+ gaming-grade PCs, monitors and peripherals for any and all attendees to enjoy over the weekend. Rest assured that if you come to enjoy the Public Play PCs then you will achieve high frame rates this year!
A huge thanks to our friends over at <a href="http://www.gexconvention.com">GEXCon</a> for helping us manage the Public PC area. Upon passing the LAN checkpoint, you will see the Public PC and LAN Theater area. The BYOC area is further back in the Maryland Ballroom.

<b><u>TOURNAMENTS / EVENTS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
We're implementing some changes to our tournaments this year. <b>Using the Public PCs for tournaments is not permitted.</b> We have also decided to reduce the number of competitive tournaments this year to allow us to focus on community-based events and have a higher quality experience for those events on our stage. Along with our events on the main MAGFest schedule, we have a selection of ad-hoc events running in the background. You can find all of the info on our events on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magfestlan/">Reddit</a>.
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>LAN THEATER</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
Our LAN Theater is in the front of the LAN room, and is the ideal place to watch many of our great LAN events. We plan to livestream with color commentary. Come see the best gamers competing to be #1! The elevated stage returns this year. Remember to tell your friends to come cheer you on!
<br/><br/>
Keep an eye out for our late night content in the LAN Theater. Stop by and check out what's planned!
