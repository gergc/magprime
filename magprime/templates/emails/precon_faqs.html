    <b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my badge?</b><br />
    When you arrive at MAGFest, go to Registration, located in Expo Hall E, to pick up your badge. 
    Once Registration opens on Thursday morning, usually at 10:00 AM, it will stay open until Sunday afternoon at 1:00 PM, 
    <strong>with three exceptions</strong>. Registration will close between 4:00AM and 7:00AM Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings. 
    Use <a href="https://guidebook.com/guide/163724/map/150973/" target="_blank"><b>this map</b></a> to help find your way to Registration on the Expo level of the convention center. Please bring a government-issued photo id such as a driver's license or military id.

<p>
    <b>Which registration line do I use?</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Staff, Bands, Guests, Vendors, Indie showcase exhibitors, and Panelists share the same line. Look for the signage inside Expo Hall E.</li>
        <li>All other pre-registered attendees (including those who purchased group registrations) should use the "Pre-Registration Badge Pickup" line inside Expo Hall E.</li>
        <li>If you are accompanied by people who have not pre-registered, they can <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/form" target="_blank"><b>purchase one online</b></a>, or use the self-service registration and payment stations located on the left side of Expo Hall E at the "At-Door Registration" sign. Cash and Credit are accepted. Once registered, proceed to the At-Door badge pickup line to make any needed payments and pick up your badge.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Where can I pick up swag that I pre-ordered, such as a t-shirt or supporter bundle?</b><br />
